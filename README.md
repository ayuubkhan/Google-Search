# Google-Search
Google Clone Web Application

This is a personal project that replicates the core functionality of Google's search services, featuring three main pages - Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. The project is designed to provide a simplified and customized Google-like experience. Here are some key features and components of this web application:

Pages:

Google Search: The main page that allows users to enter a search query and displays search results.

Google Image Search: A page where users can search for images using search queries.

Google Advanced Search: An advanced search page that enables users to fine-tune their search queries using specific criteria.

Navigation:

All pages have consistent upper-right links to navigate between each other, providing a seamless user experience.
Design:

The search bar on the Google Search page is centered with rounded corners, matching the aesthetics of Google's search bar.
The search button is centered beneath the search bar.
The "Advanced Search" button is styled with a black borderline,background white and black text.

Advanced Search:

Users can specify criteria for their search, including "all these words," "this exact word or phrase," "any of these words," and "none of these words," replicating Google's advanced search options.
I'm Feeling Lucky:

An "I'm Feeling Lucky" button is provided on the main Google Search page, which redirects users directly to the first search result for their query.
Note on Redirect Notice:

Users may encounter a redirect notice when using the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button. This is expected behavior due to a security feature implemented by Google.
Feel free to explore and interact with this project, and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements. This project was created to showcase my web development skills and replicate some of the core features of Google's search services in a personalized way.
